## NOTE for this
this was my [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) configuration.

## How To Use
if you can use this, you can clone this into your `~/.config/lvim`, into your system.
```
git clone https://github.com/Ahmada5/lvim-config.git
```

> of course my config will be upgraded sometimes, i just learned about this. thank you :)
